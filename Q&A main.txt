Greeting to pramod:
	 
	"Hello Good morning Pramod, I'm thrilled to meet you for this opportunity 
	as a UI analyst. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Google's 
	success in this role."

Tell Me About Yourself:
	My self is shivaraj, I have total of 3 years of experience in IT industry,
	in that relavant expreience i have worked on power bi for almost 2 years and remainng in looker,
	I have been part of preparing end to end reports and interactive dashboards, 
	coming to my skillsets i am good at sql, python as programming langauge,cloud services such as Azure and GCP
	and visualisation tools such as Power BI and Google looker and looker studio

End to End Project
	As part of my professional experience, I successfully contributed to the Cottonwood Financial project which is
	US based company, requirements was to get the payment schedule data for all the loans which had a transaction on 
	the previous day. 

	The challenge in this requirement was that there were multiple On-Premise SQL Server instances 
	on which the databases were placed. 

	There would be a performance barrier if we used linked servers to collect data from all the databases.
	I proposed a solution which involved copying all the On-Premise data to Azure Synapse (cloud) once everyday.

	We created data pipelines in Azure Data Factory which would copy the loan origination tables, transaction tables 
	and the payment schedule tables from all the On-Premise databases to Azure Synapse. 

	This created a significant difference in the performance of the report and mitigated the risk of linked server 
	connectivity issues. This paved way for using a single Azure Synapse instance for all the reporting needs 
	of the customer.
		
	for reporting solution,
	now The data was there in synapse analytics dedicated sql pool  and Using spark pool did a transformations and 
	cleaning, created a data modelling i,e,, star schema (facts and dimensions) and
	loading it to consuming layer where data analyst consume the data for visualisation
	then follow data analysis to identify the key values which are effective in visualizing the data. 
	Then perform transformations to ensure consistent data is available before starting the visualization. 
	I would then work on relationships between the tables so that there will not be any challenge in building interactive visuals 
	using data from multiple tables.
	Once the uniform data is ready with effective relationships between the tables,
	I would develop dashboard using different charts, KPIs, graphs and tables which ever fits the user requirement and provides 
	meaningful business insights.
	Reports:
		Customer Payment Summary: Aggregates payments by customer.
		Payment History Report: Shows historical payment data.
		Payment Due Report: Lists all upcoming payments.
		Delinquency Report: Highlights late or missed payments.
		
		
	Dashboard:
		Payment Schedule Overview: A visual representation of upcoming payments.
		Payment Trends: Charts showing payment trends over time.
		Customer Performance: Metrics on individual customer payment behavior.

The Role of Data Analyst in UX/UI Design:

	- UX, or user experience, UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems
		UX design usually comes first in the product development process, 
		A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a particular problem; 
		what steps do they take? 
		What tasks do they need to complete? 
		How straightforward is the experience?
		
	- UI, A user interface is the point of interaction between the user and  product
	—	like the touchscreen on your smartphone or the touchpad you use to select what kind of coffee you 
		want from the coffee machine.

User center design

User-centered design is about involving end-users throughout the design process. In dashboard development, it means:
•	Early Involvement: Engaging users in requirements gathering and feedback.
•	Prototyping: Creating prototypes for user testing and refining based on feedback.
•	Iterative Design: Continuously incorporating user feedback to improve the dashboard.


Designing the product experience based on the user needs goals challenges and understanding their behaviors
we are keeping this human factor and consideration while designing the a product and an experience

prototyping is small test we are going to do in order to validate your idea for getting insights for your concepts
instead of buiding the full fledged simulation we can use video as prototype approach to test and get insights from the
user early in the concept exploration stage This helped us to make product user centric and also have a solution that 
is grounded in a real problem, Sometime we end up having solution without having what problem we are trying to solve and
that doesnt lead to user centric product also lead to lot of revenue loss for the comapny while buiding produt,

Can you demonstrate your ability to present a complex dashboard to a non-technical audience?
•	Simplicity: I focus on presenting the most essential insights and avoid technical jargon.
•	Storytelling: I narrate a clear and compelling story, starting with a problem statement, data-driven findings, and actionable recommendations.
•	Visual Aids: I use visual aids, such as charts and graphs, to support the narrative and make the data more digestible.

How do you gather and incorporate user feedback into dashboard design?
•	Collect Feedback: Use surveys, user interviews, and usability tests to gather input.
•	Prioritize Feedback: Identify common pain points and prioritize improvements.
•	Iterate: Make incremental changes based on feedback and continually refine the dashboard.

Looker vs Looker studio
	Although both Looker and Looker Studio are data analytics and visualization tools, their functions are slightly different.

	Advantages of Looker:

	Data modeling: Looker offers an extensive layer for data modeling that enables users to specify connections and computations between databases, to create and update reports as the underlying data changes.

	Scalability: Looker is built to scale with expanding companies and is capable of handling big datasets.

	Customizable dashboards: Looker’s dashboards allow for the addition of text, pictures, and unique graphics to reports.

	Disadvantages of Looker

	Steep learning curve: The installation and use of Looker can be complicated.
	Cost: Looker is not cheap, particularly for tiny companies.

	Looker Studio’s Advantages

	Simple to use: Looker Studio offers a user-friendly UI for developing unique maps and reports, even for non-technical users.

	Sharing and teamwork: Looker Studio makes it simple for team members and partners to exchange and work together on reports.

	Integration: Looker Studio has larger data tool integration.

	Looker Studio’s Disadvantages

	Limited data modeling: Data modeling skills are less robust than those of Looker, it is less appropriate for complicated data analysis.

	Variety of customization choices are available with Looker Studio, but it might not be as versatile as other data visualization tools on the market.

Different types of looker instances

	Looker is Google Cloud’s cloud-native Enterprise BI Platform enabling access to near real-time data when and where 
	you need it.
	You can choose between Looker hosted solution where Looker manages all the components, 
	and a customer hosted solution where you own your environment.
	With Looker hosted solution you do not have to worry about installation, upgrades and scaling and also the time to solve issues is faster. 
	With a customer hosted solution, you have complete control on your infrastructure.
	It is possible to install Looker on a single VM but this is acceptable just for small workload databases. 
	A better solution for a production environment is a cluster of VMs 


Explain the concept of LookML and how it's used in Looker
	LookML is a language used in Looker to define data models and relationships between tables in your database. 
	It's essential because it provides a consistent, 
	reusable way to define metrics, dimensions, and joins, ensuring data consistency across dashboards.


Terminologies in looker
	Fields: 
		Fields are basically columns
		They're basically the column wise thing that tells you something about the data.
		So for example, I know this field is office name, so I know every single row in here will be an office name

	Dimensions:
		A dimension is basically a field that contains qualitative values that are used to categorize, segmentor 
		or  reveal the details in your data.
		Ex: qualitative values, so there are things like strings, names, dates, geographical data and
		quantitative values that are discrete, like, for example, ID.

	Measures:
		Measures, on the other hand, are basically numeric quantitative values that you can use to measure,
		they can be aggregated. You can basically combine five values of measures into one.

	Explores: 
		It is actually a looker specific concept. And it's basically the starting point for any data exploration and analysis.
		
		
	Looks: 
		Looks are basically explorers that have been saved.
		Looks are saved Pieces of analysis, also called reports 

	Dashboards:
		dashboards are basically a compilation of different looks and enforces some interaction between them


	Boards:
		a board is used to organize your different looks.
		so we have a board called sales data, and all of these looks relate to sales data.
		for example, the monthly reports that someone would look at related to sales
		nice about boards is after you create your board, which is a compilation of different reports,
		you can then send that and share it with people very easily.


	Folders:
		Folders have the same meaning as folders in your computer they're used to store your files.
		Your files or reports and dashboards. we can save reports, looks and dashboards in folders
	

Production deployment of looker
https://blog.searce.com/multistage-deployment-in-looker-dev-stg-prod-f2103cbcda5f

Have you used version control systems like Git for collaborative work in data analysis and dashboard development? If so, how?
•	Yes, I use Git for version control to track changes in LookML files, SQL queries, and report configurations. 
This allows for collaboration with team members while maintaining a history of changes and the ability to revert if needed.
