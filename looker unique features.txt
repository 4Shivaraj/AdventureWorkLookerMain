LookML is Looker's modeling language, and it offers several distinct advantages:

Semi-Structured Metadata: 	LookML allows you to define metadata in a semi-structured way. 
				You can create reusable objects like dimensions, measures, and fields, and 
				then use these throughout your data models and reports. 
				This approach ensures consistency and reduces redundancy in your data definitions.

Version Control: 		Looker provides built-in version control for LookML files, which is critical for tracking changes, 
				collaborating with a team, and maintaining a history of data model modifications.

Centralized Data Model 
Management: 			LookML centralizes data model definitions, making it easier to maintain and update your data models. 
				When changes are made in LookML, they are reflected across all reports and dashboards that use those definitions.

Data Source Flexibility
&
Cloud based platform:	 	Looker supports a wide range of data sources and has extensive connector options. 
				This flexibility makes it suitable for organizations with diverse data environments

Data Abstraction: 		With LookML, you can abstract complex SQL queries into more understandable business logic. 
				This means that non-technical users can work with data without needing to write SQL queries, 
				making it accessible to a broader audience.

Enhanced Collaboration: 	LookML encourages collaboration among data analysts, data engineers, 
				and business users. Data analysts can define data models, and business users 
				can create their own reports and dashboards using those models.

Reusable Components: 		You can create reusable LookML components that encapsulate complex calculations or transformations. 
				These components can be shared and reused across different reports and dashboards.

Data Governance: 		LookML facilitates data governance by ensuring that data models are consistent and well-documented. 
				You can add descriptions, labels, and other metadata to make it easier for users to understand the data.

Performance Optimization: 	LookML provides performance optimization features, allowing you to optimize the generated SQL queries, 
				which can lead to faster report execution and reduced strain on your database.

Embedding and Integration: 	Looker offers various options for embedding its reports and dashboards directly into other applications and platforms.
				This makes it a valuable tool for organizations that want to integrate data analytics seamlessly into their products or services.

Permission and Security Model: 	Looker provides a robust security and permission model, allowing administrators to control who can access specific data 
				and reports. It also offers row-level security, which ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to view.

Looker (API) â€“ 			Looker API is used for calling data while providing a secure RESTful API that allows users to create custom applications, 
				workflows, and scripts that can automate tasks.

Sit on top of database:		Direct Database Connectivity: 
				Looker can connect directly to your database, which allows you to leverage 
				the power and performance of your existing database system. This means you can take advantage of your 
				database's indexing, query optimization, and data processing capabilities.

				Live Data Access: 
				By sitting on top of the database, Looker provides real-time or near-real-time access to your data. 
				This is especially beneficial for organizations that require up-to-the-minute insights and analytics.

				Reduced Data Redundancy: 
				Looker's approach minimizes data redundancy. Instead of replicating and storing data in a separate data warehouse, 
				Looker connects directly to the source, reducing the need for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and 
				associated data storage costs.

				Scalability and Performance: 
				Leveraging the underlying database's scalability and performance capabilities, 
				Looker can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it well-suited for organizations with significant data requirements.

				Data Freshness: 
				Since Looker is closely tied to the database, changes and updates in the database are reflected in real time. 
				This ensures that your analytics are always based on the most current data.

				Compatibility: 
				Looker can work with a wide range of database management systems, making it adaptable to the specific technology
				stack that your organization uses.

Most importantly it is built by developers
Implementing the development workflows ideas like generally in enterprise environment we talk about 
* Developement
* Staging
* Production
That is the sequence which any application is actually deployed in enterprise environment 
Looker bring the same workflow ideas to data analytics
